antur, perlegere debent libros tractantes ea quae
effectus istos turpes haud raro excitant ;¹ neque enim ii,
seposito periculo voluntatis consensuS, ulla lege pro-
hibentur ne ejusmodi libros legant; contra vero, quum
omnino eis liceat haec officia et artes exercere, jus
profecto habent adhibendi medii cujusvis in se liciti, quo
rite in his exercendis instruantur.

114. Quae tertia conditio ut rite intelligatur, integre
exponendum est undenam oriatur, et quousque se
extendat, obligatio qua quis aliquando (n. 95.) teneatur
abstinere quominus causam, etsi in se omnino licitam,
ponat, ne malus effectus praevisus inde sequatur. Itaque
tria haec principia statuenda sunt :—

1 15. Principium 1.--A ctio, alioquin z'n se omnino licita,
aliquando illz'cz'ta evadit ex eo quod effectus malus prae-
videtur inde secuturus. Sic vg. per se licitum est gladium
alteri commodare: potest tamen id illicitum fieri ex eo

of which the existence was altogether unknown till this disaster. Several
of the passengers are consequently drowned. To hang the pilot as a
murderer on account of this missortune would be universally allowed to
be an act of atrocious injustice. But if the voyage of the pilot be itself
a high offence‚ ought that circumstance alone to turn his missortune into
a murder? Suppose that he is engaged conveying an offender beyond the
reach of justice3 that he has kidnapped some nativos, and is carrying them
to a ship which is to convey them to some foreign colony; [liat he is
violating the laws of quarantine at a time when it is of the highest im-
portance that those laws should be strictly observed3 that he is carrying
supplies, (leserters, and intelligence to the enemies of the State. The
offence of such a pilot ought. undoubtedly. to be severely punished. But
to pronounce him guilty of one offence‚ because a missortune besel him
while he was committing another offence,—t0 pronounce him the murderer
of people whose lives he never meant to endanger, whom he was doing his
best to carry sase to their destination, and whose death has been purely
accidentaL—is surely to consound all the boundaries of crime.’'—Macaulay,
Noaees on tlze lmlian Penal C ode, Νοίι1 (M.)

Dum haec prelo subjiciuntur (auno 1879), Londini in curia legislativa
agitur, rogantibus iis qui rebus publicis pxaesecti sunt [tlte sllz'nz'slry], de lege
statuenda [Cede ofCrz'minal Low] qua emendentur et componantur omnia
ea quaein legibus Angliae traduntur de malefactis, de forma judiciorum
quae puniendorum maleficiorum causa instituuntur, atque de poenis cujus-
que maleficii infligendis. Inter cetera agitur de abrogando absono illo
juris praescripto supra dicto. ’
