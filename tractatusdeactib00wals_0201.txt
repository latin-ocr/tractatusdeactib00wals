eo quod spolia quaedam contra Dei praeceptum, licet

ut falsam atque Christianis maxime injuriosam repellit
calumniam eorum qui tribuebant iis doctrinam huic op-

Quorum damnatio justa est.'’—Quo sensu S. Augustinus,

“ Almost all authors, Catholic and Protestant, admit that when cz just
cause is presenl, there is some kind or other of vei-bal misleading which is
not a sui. . .

“ The most direct mode of verbal misleading is actually sayz'ng tlte thing
tlzat ts ηοω and it is defended [by some] on the principle that such words
are nol a lie where there is a ‘justa causa,³ as killz'ug is not murder in the
case ot an executioner . . . .

“ Another mode of verbal misleading is equiwcation or a play upon
words; audit is defended on the theory that to lie is to use words in a
sense which they will not bear3 . . an equivocator uses them in a received
sense, though there is another received sense, and therefore, according to
this definitiom he does not lie ί . . Others say that all equivocations are,
after all, a kind of lying3 and some of these disputants inser that . . equi-
vocation is but a half-measure, and that it is better to say at once that in
certain cases untruths are not lies . . . .

“ I think the historical course of thought upon the matter has been this;
the Greek Fathers [vid. Suarez, De Legibus, Lib. 9. cap. xvii. nn. 4—6
(Ed. Vives, Tom. vi. p. 512.) ] thought that when there was ajusla causa,
an untrutlz need not be a lie. St. Augustine took another view, though
with great misgiving 3 and, whether he is rightly interpreted or not, is the
doctor of the great and common view that all untruths are lies, and that
there can be no just cause of untruth. . . .

‘¹ In not ranging myself with those who consider that it is justifiable to
use words in a double sense, that is, to equivocate‚ Ι put myself under
the protection of such authors as Cardinal Gerdil . . and others . . .

‘⁴ If all killing be not murder, nor all taking from another slealing, why
must all untruths be lies? I will say sreely that I think it difficult to answer
this question ; at the same time, Ι never acted upon such a theory myself. . .

“As to equivocation‚ I suppose it is from the English habit, but, without
